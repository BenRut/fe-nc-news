# NC News

This React.js web application was created as part of the Front-end module for the Northcoders Developer Pathway Bootcamp, using the NC News API built in the backend module. The concept behind the application is a News App similar to reddit in which users can view, comment on and vote on articles.

To run the file locally, download the repo and run:

\```bash
npm i
npm start
\```

Alternatively, you can visit [NC News](https://gracious-lewin-ecf252.netlify.com/) to view a hosted version of the site on Netlify.
